# SSI Revocation Protocol with Threshold Governance

**Decentralized Architecture for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) with Tamper-Prevention Mechanisms**

A proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of a decentralized digital identity (Self-Sovereign Identity / SSI) revocation protocol utilizing **Threshold Governance** and Immutable Audit Logs (via **Sigstore Trillian/Rekor**). This project is designed to prevent unilateral revocation (tamper-prevention) by any single entity.
The system is built on **Kubernetes** orchestration and integrates industry security standards such as **RBAC**, **Distributed Rate Limiting**, **Threshold Signatures**, and **Immutable Audit Logs**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Security & Tamper Prevention
- **Threshold Governance (k-of-n):** Prevents a *single point of compromise*. Credential revocation requires cryptographic signatures (Ed25519) from *k* independent validators before being written to the ledger.
- **Immutable Audit Trail:** Every successful verification is recorded in a **Transparency Log** (Merkle Tree-based via Trillian/Rekor) to ensure verification history cannot be secretly altered.
- **Zero-Trust Network:** Inter-service communication is restricted using **Kubernetes NetworkPolicies**. Only specific paths (e.g., Governance → Issuer) are allowed.
- **Secret Management:** Sensitive credentials (Wallet Keys, DB Passwords, JWT Secrets) are securely injected via Kubernetes Secrets instead of being hardcoded.

### 2. Performance & Reliability
- **Auto-Scaling (HPA):** The *Verification Gateway* and *Issuer Agent* automatically scale replicas (Pods) when CPU usage exceeds 60%.
- **Distributed Rate Limiting:** Uses **Redis** to synchronize rate limits across pod replicas, preventing global DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Handles Kubernetes `SIGTERM` signals to close database connections and complete active requests before pod termination.

### 3. Privacy Preservation
- **Verifiable Credentials & ZKP:** Verification occurs without raw data exchange using the *Present Proof* protocol from Hyperledger Aries.
- **Sanitized Errors:** API responses are cleaned of sensitive stack traces to prevent information leakage.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

![SSI Architecture](image/architechture-SSI-DID.png)

### Core Components & Technologies

1. **VDR (Verifiable Data Registry):** Uses Hyperledger Indy deployed locally via VON-Network.
2. **Identity Agents:** Uses Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) for **Issuer** and **Verifier** roles.
3. **Governance Service (Tamper Prevention):** Custom Node.js service implementing **Threshold Signatures (k-of-n)** to prevent unilateral credential revocation by a single admin.
4. **Verification Gateway:** Node.js middleware handling credential verification, **Distributed Rate Limiting** (via Redis), and audit trail logging.
5. **Transparency Log:** Uses Sigstore Trillian & Rekor to provide **immutable** Merkle Tree-based audit logs.
6. **Databases:**
   - **PostgreSQL:** Wallet storage for ACA-Py.
   - **MySQL 8.0:** Merkle Tree storage backend for Trillian.
   - **Redis:** State management for Rate Limiting and Governance quorum.

## 🏗️ Setup Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** (with Kubernetes enabled)
- **kubectl** CLI
- **Git**
- **Python 3**

---

### 2. Setup Local Indy Ledger (VON-Network)

The system requires a running Indy network. We use `von-network` for local simulation.

```powershell
# Run outside this repository directory
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/von-network.git
cd von-network
./manage build
./manage start
```

Ensure the Web UI is accessible at: `http://localhost:9000`

---

### 3. Build & Deploy SSI Kit

#### Build Local Images (If scripts changed)

```powershell
# Governance Service
cd src/governance-service
docker build -t dn06/ssi:governance-service-v1 .

# Verification Gateway
cd ../verification-gateway
docker build -t dn06/ssi:gateway-middleware-v1 .
```

#### Deploy to Kubernetes

```powershell
# Return to project root
kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml
```

---

### 4. Verify Status

Ensure all pods are `Running`:

```powershell
kubectl get pods -n ssi-network
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios (Step-by-Step)

### A. Threshold Revocation Mechanism (Admin)

Prevents unilateral credential revocation.

#### Step 1: Submit Proposal (Requires Admin JWT)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/proposals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_ADMIN_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "REVOKE_CREDENTIAL",
    "payload": { "cred_rev_id": "1", "rev_reg_id": "RR-123" }
  }'
```

Output:
```json
{"proposalId": "uuid-123...", "status": "PENDING"}
```

#### Step 2: Validator Voting (Threshold Security)

Repeat for 3 different validators:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/proposals/<PROPOSAL_ID>/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "validatorId": "validator_1",
    "signature": "<ED25519_SIGNATURE>"
  }'
```

**Result:** Once quorum is reached (e.g., 3 of 5), the Governance Service automatically calls the Issuer Agent to write to the ledger.

---

### B. Secure Verification & Audit Trail (Verifier)

#### Step 1: Send Verification Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_VERIFIER_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "proof_request_data": {
      "name": "Check Degree",
      "version": "1.0",
      "requested_attributes": {
        "attr1_referent": { "name": "degree", "restrictions": [] }
      }
    }
  }'
```

#### Step 2: Check Audit Log in Rekor (Transparency Log)

```bash
# Access Rekor API directly
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/log/entries?logIndex=0
```

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- **RBAC & Network Policies:** Traffic isolation between pods.
- **Secret Management:** Wallet keys stored as Kubernetes Secrets.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Holder privacy preserved via Hyperledger Aries standards.
